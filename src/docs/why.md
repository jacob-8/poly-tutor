# Why?

Poly Tutor is a personal assistant for language learners who would like to live and function in a new language. Whether you are reading a book, watching a show, having a convesation, or writing something, Poly Tutor is like having a personal language assistant right with you to help you along with the words you don't know yet. It is based on the principle that you learn language fastest when it is meaningful and comprehsible.

## Alternatives

If all you want to do is to read, listen, and speak in a new language, there are already a lot of good options for you to choose from.

- [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/) for reading and listening to content you choose with a built-in dictionary and flashcard system that tracks known words
- [Speak](https://www.speak.com/), [yourteacher.ai](https://yourteacher.ai/), [TalkPal](https://talkpal.ai/) for speaking practice with AI conversation partners
- [VoiceTube](https://www.voicetube.com/) for watching videos with transcriptions, definitions, pronunciation practice and vocab review
- [YouGlish](https://youglish.com/) to hear many varied uses of a particular word in context.
- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for gamified language learning using interactive exercises to walk you along a learning path
- [Conjuu](https://conjuu.com/) for verb conjugation practice in French, Spanish, German, and Italian

Please use those tools and similar ones as they meet your needs. I like LingQ the best because it does the best of letting me read and listen to content that I'm interested in and keeps track of my known words. However, in learning Chinese, it's useless to me because it has no graded reader function which will keep pinyin pronunciation helps for unknown words but hide them for known words. I want to reinforce my knowledge of known characters while also making it fast to learn new ones. This was the original inspiration for Poly Tutor. As AI technologies have improved, the abilities of Poly Tutor can also be expanded to become an assistant that keeps track of my previous thoughts, conversations, and questions.

## Direction

You can think of the direction that Poly Tutor is moving in as a combination of LingQ, a conversational chatbot, and a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). Zettelkasten means "second brain" and is a note-taking method that uses links to connect ideas and store them away for easy retrieval later. It's a way of remembering and being able to quickly create new ideas from combinations of old ones as you do your day to day work (See [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for the best code editor + markdown powered implementation and [Quivr](https://www.quivr.app/) for the best AI-powered implementation). So Poly Tutor is not just a show captioning tool with language learners in mind, but a tool designed to help you function as a capable adult in a new language while your language skills are still developing.

## Who is it for?

When you first start learning a language, you should find a good foundational textbook or course to help give you a foundation in your new language. Poly Tutor is not designed for the beginner. It's designed for the person who has now gotten enough language ability to be bored by contrived dialogues that have no real connection to real life beyond their purpose to help you engage in real life in the future. If you are in the middle zone between beginner and fully functional in a new language and would to interact in real life as much as possible, then Poly Tutor is for you.
