# Supabase values are overridden by .env.development values when running locally. This assumes you've run `pnpx supabase start`. If you don't care about updating the database schema and running Supabase locally, you can simply delete the .env.development file to use these values instead and dev against the production database, just as if you were using the live site. Note that you won't be able to perform functions that require a Supabase service role key, such as adding YouTube videos and channels to the database.
