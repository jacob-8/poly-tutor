## Learn from:

- [Hyperfetch](https://hyperfetch.bettertyped.com/)
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) & [SSWR](https://github.com/ConsoleTVs/sswr)

## Goals

- use [indexedDB](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval) for offline persistence
- don't refetch if already fetched on server
- provides typed stores for each data option that can be loaded so that in the page you can subscribe to the value or have the needed mutate/change function available - that function makes the change and also optimistically updates the store
- easy to add mock values for Kitbook
- pagination
