# Setup Dev Environment

## Frontend

- Install the recommended VSCode extensions (ESLint is mandatory - your PRs will fail if you don't lint before comtting so save yourself the hassle and use the extension as you work).
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) globaly using `npm install -g pnpm` if you don't have it yet. 
- Install dependencies with `pnpm i`. 

## Backend

If you only use the Kitbook to make frontend changes, you don't need to worry about the backend. If you want to make changes to the backend, you will need to install Docker and Supabase CLI.

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and make sure it is running
- [Install supabase cli locally](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) *- you can skip this the first few times and just prepend `pnpx ` to the Supabase commands, but after awhile you will tire of waiting for pnpx on each command*
- Read through which services require environment variables in the the example `.env_local_example` file. Depending on what you are developing you may need to provide some of these keys locally that are provided to the production app in Vercel's environment variables.
