## i18n

- See https://poly-i18n.vercel.app/ to understand the setup.
- Use the `lokalise.i18n-ally` extension in VSCode. To add a new string, simply select the string, use the `i18n ally: extract text into i18n messages` command, give a two level path based on the page, e.g. `shows.title`, and then hover over the result and use the extensions auto-translate buttons to quickly provide translations for the other languages.
